            Embarking on my journey as a web developer, I am Alexander Stepanov,
            an enthusiastic novice in the world of IT. Currently, I am actively
            mastering JavaScript, React, and other modern technologies that
            enable the creation of beautiful and functional websites. My studies
            at Elbrus Bootcamp present an exciting challenge, akin to ascending
            uncharted peaks.

            Learning from my background as a railway engineer, I bring extensive
            experience in the construction industry. I have contributed to
            construction sites, conducted laser scanning on the renowned Lakhta
            Center project, worked as a designer and BIM-coordinator, and delved
            into 3D and 4D modeling. This journey has honed my analytical
            thinking, teamwork skills, and ability to integrate modern
            technologies into projects.

            Being an avid traveler and hiker, I find joy in exploring nature.
            Among my most cherished adventures are horseback riding in the Altai
            Mountains and swimming in crystal-clear alpine lakes. A highlight
            was a 7-day hike in Prielbrusie, and I aspire to summit Elbrus
            itself one day.

            Regular physical activity energizes my life. I have practiced karate
            for nine years, ventured into hand-to-hand combat, skiing, and
            boxing, and now I passionately engage in CrossFit. These experiences
            enrich my life and fuel my drive to stay active.

            Unwinding during my free time, I enjoy playing board games with
            friends and watching captivating films. My fascination with
            technology began in childhood, tinkering with flashing phones,
            building computers, and exploring how things work. This passion
            guided my decision to pursue a career in IT.
          </p>

          <p class="referense">
            Savoring the simple joys of life, I adore animals and delicious
            food—my delightful weaknesses! Looking ahead, I dream of traveling
            to Thailand, China, Japan, and Korea to immerse myself in their
            cultures and savor their culinary treasures.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe that perseverance and passion for learning will help me
            achieve my goals and become an IT professional.
